# ⚡️ Viact

<p>Viact is a starter template for React TypeScript that uses Vitejs, which supports RTL for specific styles, proxy fetching API (to fix CORS errors) and a simple mock REST API server. <br />Additionally, Is set up VScode, Storybook, ErrorBoundary, UnoCss (atomic CSS engine), Eslint, Prettier, and more.</p>

# Synopsis & Motivation

<p>It's an opinionated setup for modern web applications (a GitHub template). This is a set of essential (and minimal) libraries, components, and utilities that developers typically require when developing React applications.</p>
<p>Almost all projects need to have a router, a UI framework, error handling, base file/folder structure, a builder, some developer tools (eslint, prettier, postcss, etc), and many more. As a starter kit, we tried to include the best options available in the above fields.</p>
